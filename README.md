#LWC Playground Example: Bike App  
This example component is meant to show a number of ECMAScript 2015 and later features that also feature in building Lightning Web Components: the new programming model for customizing UI on Salesforce. 

To view this, clone the repo: 

    > git clone git@github.com:pchittum/bike-app-lwc-playground.git

Then simply upload the root project folder to a new empty LWC [playground](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/tools/playground). (One note, I've not actually tested this with git project files in place, so, well, this may have unexpected results.)

You can find the LWC playground at https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/tools/playground
